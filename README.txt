A game where there is a word to be guessed, and the game gives clues depending on the letters in the guess. 
  If the player gets:
    - A letter: That is the correct letter for that space
    - A +: That letter is in the word
    - A *: That letter is not in the word    
    
This is my second program, so the code will probably be disorganized.
